    desc:"Small island communities rely on local shipping lines to deliver goods in the same way that large islands and continents do.The list of items moved on the small ships that serve these remote communities is wide, and includes food, building materials and vehicles. One particular cargo, however, recently carried onboard the palletised-cargo carrier Gry Maritha, pushed the captain’s responsibility towards the ship’s cargo literally over the edge. The 590 gross tonnage ship was on its regular route between Penzance on the UK southeast mainland and Hugh Town on St Mary’s, the largest of the Scilly Isles with a population of around 2000, when two of its passengers – meerkats Doris and Boris – managed to escape from their cage whilst arriving in Penzance, reveals a recent BBC report. After their escape the two meerkats, which were being transported from Saint Mary’s to a zoo on the mainland, ran around on deck, during which time Doris was captured by the crew, said the BBC. Boris, however, “jumped 30ft (10m) into the water”. The ship’s master, Tom Sexton, decided to get into the water and rescue the animal, which weighed just under a kilo. "

    desc:"Royal Caribbean International’s most recent addition to its fleet, Wonder of the Seas, arrived in the US for the first time on 20 February.The 236,857-gt cruise ship, the largest in the world by gross tonnage, was greeted with great fanfare as it sailed into Fort Lauderdale on the east coast of Florida, where it will spend the next two months sailing the eastern and western Caribbean and visiting Royal Caribbean’s private island, CocoCay. Wonder of the Seas joins four sister Oasis-class ships which are ranked as the largest cruise ships in the world, according to Marine Insight. The vessel is both owned and operated by the US cruise operator, and built by Chantiers de L’Antique in Saint-Nazaire, France. The first steel was cut in April 2019 and it was originally scheduled to begin operations off of China in Q2 last year, but the Coronavirius pandemic delayed delivery and led to a changed itinerary."

    title:'When coal cuts out',
    desc:"The first 21 days of 2022 have not been the best for the dry bulk industry. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), an indicator of the average prices paid to transport dry bulk cargoes such as coal, was at one of its lowest levels seen over the past year on 20 January. Following a yearly high of 5,650 points on 7 October, the index dropped to 3,353 on 7 December The fall in freight rates seen since October is due in part to reduced coal and iron ore imports to China –  the largest coal importing nation overall    The BDI then dropped further to 1,415 points on 21 January. Already weak rates were compounded by a surprise Indonesian government announcement on 1 January, banning coal exports to curb dwindling supplies of domestically sourced coal at the country’s electric power plants. Indonesia’s energy mix is dependent on coal and nearly all of its electricity is generated through coal-powered infrastructure  The ban, introduced due to fear of nation-wide blackouts, was initially planned for the entire month. But following an inventory evaluation, there were reports by mid January of laden vessels leaving as the government started to allow exports once again."

    title:'The MarineTraffic definition of ship tracking',
    desc:'nderstanding not only where the ships currently are, but also where they have been and will be, translates into more visibility and transparency on what’s happening at sea and enables significant decisions.    From essential daily business operations (such as real-time cargo or fleet tracking) to people simply following the movements of the vessels carrying their loved ones, ship tracking software is widely known and used. But what is ship tracking and how does this system work in practice? What is ship tracking  As the name suggests, ship tracking is the process of monitoring the movements of commercial ships, smaller craft, and other marine vessels. The ship tracking system is a collection of equipment that enables the display of the real-time positions of vessels on a map as well as essential information about each ship.   There are many ship tracking methods, with the most commonly used in the maritime world being the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Automatic Identification System (AIS).    While GPS is useful as a local/onboard position reporting system, the Automatic Identification System uses the GPS technology and makes the tracking information widely available. AIS transponders have their own GPS receivers built-in (separate from the vessel’s receiver) in order to acquire the vessel’s position and prepare the self-position report that will be transmitted to others via radio frequencies.'

    title:'North Sea ‘energiser’',
    desc:' Early this year (February) the Danish government took the bold move to develop the world’s first artificial island specifically for the capture of green energy. The energy island will be located in the North Sea, around 80 km off the Danish west coast, where, according to energy-focussed fund management company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), “conditions for green energy production based on offshore wind are optimal”.   The island will have a minimum capacity of 3 gigawatts when it starts operating in 2033, with potential for expansion to 10 gigawatts of offshore wind. When running at full capacity the island should be able to supply 10 million households with their energy needs.  According to the Danish Energy Agency, the island’s exact design has not yet been determined. It noted, however, that an island expected to handle 3 gigawatts of offshore wind will likely be the size of at least 120,000 m2 – equivalent to 18 football fields and when expanded, 64 football pitches.'
