    title:'THANK YOU SEAFARERS!',
    desc:"World Maritime Day, celebrated this year on September 30th, is an annual observance created by the United Nations to recognize the maritime industry’s contribution to the global economy. The International Maritime Organization chose seafarers at the core of shipping’s future as the theme to celebrate this year’s special day. And rightly so, as approximately 90% of global trade is carried on ships. As IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim succinctly put it, Shipping drives world trade and that trade simply does not happen without seafarers. Around the world, there are over 1.6 million seafarers manning approximately 50,000 merchant ships that transport so many things we depend on in our daily lives, including medical supplies, personal protective equipment, consumer goods, and nearly everything else used in modern society.",

    title:"FATIGUE BARGES IN ON ANOTHER INCIDENT",
    desc:"Recently, while under tow by the towing vessel Island Chief, an unmanned barge crashed into a private waterfront home and several privately-owned docks in Gig Harbor, Washington. At the time of the incident, the barge was not carrying any cargo, and it was pulled free by the tug without any injuries, pollution or significant vessel damage. Unfortunately, however, the damages to the affected property are estimated to be over $250,000 and the Investigating Officer has determined this to be a Serious Marine Incident. According to gCaptainsBarge Crashes Into Home in Washington article:“The Coast Guard reports that initial findings indicate that the Island Chief’s [captain] fell asleep while navigating the vessel.” "

    title:"USCG WARNS MARINERS AGAINST DISABLING AIS",
    desc:"The USCG has issued a warning to mariners to not disable their vessel's Automated Identification System (AIS) due to the potential for danger and the legal consequences they could face.As US Coast Guard Sector Columbia River boarding team supervisor Lt. Collin Gruin states, AIS is a vital tool in a host of Coast Guard missions including search and rescue and port security. It's not only illegal to turn it off but also incredibly dangerous.AIS is a maritime navigation safety communications system that automatically transmits vessel information to shore stations, other ships, and aircraft. Vessel identity, type, position, course, speed, navigational status, and safety-related information are included in the transmissions. The communications system also automatically receives such information from similarly fitted ships; monitors and tracks ships; and exchanges data with shore-based facilities."

    desc:'Infamy is not a term anyone wants to be associated with. But, in the case of a maritime incident gone viral, some of the world’s best and most experienced mariners have unwittingly become infamous. Just like James E. Mercante, Esq., a partner and maritime attorney at Rubin, Fiorella, Friedman & Mercante LLP, states in his recent article “The ‘Ever Given’ Will Ruin More Than Just a Muddy Canal,” “any type of major marine casualty will not only ruin a captain or pilot’s entire day, but can be agonizing and costly for years.”'

    title:'WHO NEEDS THE JONES ACT?',
    desc:' Whoever could have predicted that a federal law enacted in 1920 would be stirring up so much controversy more than a full century later? Well, that’s precisely what’s happened in recent weeks with the Jones Act, which regulates maritime commerce in the United States. The statute, among other things, requires that ships carrying cargo between the nation’s ports must be U.S.-owned, -built, -crewed, and -registered.'
